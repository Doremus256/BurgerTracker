Motivation: 
<br>
The challenge with this project was making use of express.handlebars to more easily update client-side HTML, with the goal of creating an application that can keep track of a list with a single identifying attribute (whether the burgers brought in via MySQL are to be deemed "Devoured" or not) and manipulating corresponding DOM elements accordingly.

Development Summary:
<br>
I started this project at 4pm and finished at 7pm. At this point, I am comfortable enough with all aspects of the full stack we have learned so far that I could teach this assignment to someone. Furthermore, this app's functionality could easily be expanded due to the modular nature of custom ORM methods. All I would need to do is add the needed orm.method, route and AJAX requests for the query I am interested in, and adjust the views to allow this new info to be displayed on the DOM.
